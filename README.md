# Python â€“  API - Challenge


This particular challenge is divided into two sections; weatherPy and vacationPy. The problem solving goal of this exercise Is to find at least 500 random places around the world in order to find a vacation spot with the best weather.
Programmatically, the goal of this exercise is to understand how to use API calls to gather information and to use the Google Maps API to create and display maps in The jupyter Notebook using python code. 

## WeatherPy
The first section, weatherPy, generates a random sample of latitude and longitude into a list. the latitude and longitude list is used to find at least 500 unique city names for the next step of the program.
After the list of city names is compiled an API call is made to openweathermap to obtain desired weather data in imperial units. 
The API call uses cities list to loop through and return the following data points into their respective lists:

- Latitude
- Longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Humidity
- Cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Country name
- City name
- City number
- Date

**Warning:** This API call originally ran too quickly to limit the quantity of calls to 60 requests per minute, which is the maximum under the free account license. To remedy this issue the time.sleep(1) function was used to add 1 second between each successive API call.
